# Permutation-Entropy

Permutation Entropy (PE) is a nonparametric technique that unlike econometric reductionist models (e.g., moving average-autoregressive ARMA representations and ARIMA models) can be applied to any type of time series (regular, chaotic, noisy, experimental or reality based), and is characterized by its conceptual simplicity and computational speed. It has been used as a feature in machine learning models for anomaly detection. Applications of PE in the economic literature are ["A Non-parametric test Using permutation Entropy"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2007.12.005) by Matilla-García and Ruiz Marín, and ["Permutation Entropy and Information Recovery in Nonlinear Dynamic Economic Time Series"](https://doi.org/10.3390/econometrics7010010) by Henry and Judge.
