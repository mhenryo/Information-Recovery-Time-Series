# Permutation-Entropy

Permutation Entropy (PE) is a robust nonparametric technique that unlike econometric reductionist models (e.g., moving average-autoregressive ARMA representations and ARIMA models) can be applied to any type of time series (regular, chaotic, noisy, experimental or reality based), and is characterized by its conceptual simplicity and computational speed. It has been used as a feature in machine learning models for anomaly detection. Some applications of PE in the economics literature are ["A Non-parametric test Using permutation Entropy"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2007.12.005) by Matilla-García and Ruiz Marín, ["Structural breaks and the time-varying levels of weak-form efficiency in crude oil markets: Evidence from the Hurst exponent and Shannon entropy methods](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.inteco.2014.10.001) by Mensi et al., and ["Permutation Entropy and Information Recovery in Nonlinear Dynamic Economic Time Series"](https://doi.org/10.3390/econometrics7010010) by Henry and Judge.

In our study, published in the _Econometrics_ journal and using the PE and rolling window approach, we delve into complex economic systems (the Dow Jones Industrial Average) and unveil their hidden dynamics by capturing the ordinal relationships between individual values in the non-linear time series and revealing a probability distribution of these patterns. This, in turn, allowed us to quantify the degree of complexity inherent in the system's behavior.
